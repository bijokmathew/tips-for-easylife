### Bugs 

During the development stage, found many minor and major issues .The following bugs took time to resolve.

1. During Responsive test case, form page and text area are not fit in to the smaller screen devices and it is very hard to set the width for form and text-area eaxactly without affecting the look for smaller device.
  - Solution:  Calculated the large screen  device width and calculated the width of form and text area in % so that no need to give seperate value for smaller devices    

2. Top menu disappears even though its fixed.
 - Solution: Used z-index to keep the navigation menu on top of all sections and elements, value set to 20
 
### Validator Testing 

At each stage of the wesite development various types testing was executed to find the issues by using using Chrom Dev Tools.
After the completed version of the website, used three forms of validations to verify the code stability. Also carried out the responsive test for different screen resolution by using chrome tool.
